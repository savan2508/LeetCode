# LeetCode
LeetCode
This repository contains my solutions to problems on LeetCode. LeetCode is a popular online platform where developers can practice coding problems, test their skills, and prepare for technical interviews.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders based on the problem category. Each folder contains a set of solutions to problems in that category. The file names include the problem number, name, and extension (e.g., prb01.py).

Running the Code
Each file contains a solution to a specific problem on LeetCode. The code is currently written in Python, but support for additional languages such as C++, Java, and JavaScript will be added in the future. To run the code, you can simply open the file in a Python editor (e.g., PyCharm) and run it.

Alternatively, you can copy and paste the code into the LeetCode editor and run it there. Note that the LeetCode platform requires specific input and output formats, so you may need to modify the code slightly to work on the platform.

Contributing
